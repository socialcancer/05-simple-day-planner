# 05 Simple Day Planner

## Description

Using local storage, js, jquery, and moment.js. I created a daily planner which gives the ability to track activities within a work day.

## Usage

The User must input text into each block and hit the lock to save to local storage. Clicking the lock once the text has been inputed will give the User the ability to edit the text once more.
